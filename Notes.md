Separates variability shared and specific across datasets. Used for identification of sample subgroups, imputation, detection of outliers. Refs to multi-omics single-cell technologies. Group Factor Analysis-based (Fig 1), good methods (supplemental) and interpretation description.  Compared with iCluster and canonical GFA. MOFAtools R package interfaced with a Python module.
