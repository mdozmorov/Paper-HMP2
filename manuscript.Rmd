# Abstract

HMP2Data is a Bioconductor package providing the data of the integrative Human Microbiome Project (iHMP), also known as the second phase of HMP project (HMP2). It contains 16S rRNA sequencing data from three longitudinal studies, 1) MOMS-PI, pregnancy and preterm birth; 2) IBD, gut disease onset, inflammatory bowel disease; and 3) T2D, onset of type 2 diabetes and respiratory viral infection. Where available, other data is also provided, such as cytokine measures. Raw data files were downloaded from the HMP Data Analysis and Coordination Center. Processed data is provided as matrices, SummarizedExperiment, MultiAssayExperiment, and phyloseq class objects.

# Introduction

The development of metagenomics is fueled by the falling costs of sequencing. Owning to the fact that microbial genomes are much smaller than vertebrate genomes, relatively small amount of sequencing (and costs) provides an affordable way to generate rich and useful sequencing. Consequently, several consortia generated and made available unique datasets illuminating the microbial diversity of life. 

One of the most important aspects of open science is data availability, allowing data reanalysis and investigation of questions not envisioned in the original studies. The raw sequencing data and processed OTU tables are frequently available from public repositories such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Short Read Archive (SRA). Individual studies, such as  Databases containing data from multiple studies, such as MicrobiomeHD [@Duvallet:2017aa], Qiita [@Gonzalez:2018aa], are also being created.

Although the data availability is essential, methods for its analysis are no less important. Various software solutions have been implemented to access specific datasets, such as Jupyter notebooks for the analysis of the American Gut project [@McDonald:2018aa], as well as web-based platforms, such as Qiita [@Gonzalez:2018aa]. Although the R/Bioconductor ecosystem is a de facto standard in genomics research [@Gentleman:2004aa], R-based methods to access microbiome data still lag behind. The `HMP16Sdata` R package pioneered 

The ability to integrate multiple layers of omics data is another enticing possibility envisioned by the iHMP consortium. Several complementary datasets from the same subjects were expected to be generated. Consequently, methods for integrative analysis of microbiome omics data have been developed, reviewed in .

The iHMP data was generated by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, a common taxonomic marker for bacteria and archaea [@Olsen:1986aa].



# Methods

The data in BIOM format [@Buttigieg:2016aa] were downloaded from ...

Greengenes v.13.5 database contaiting taxonomy annotations at 7 levels was used to annotate IDs in the 'biom' files (`gg_13_5_taxonomy.txt.gz`, downloaded at 01/25/2019).

# Discussion

- Data is not perfect - lots has been promised, limited delivery. Limitations of integrative analysis.

- OTUs are not perfect, describe other binning metrics
Sequence analysis and taxonomic profiling of iHMP data were done by assigning sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) clustered by sequence similarity to existing rRNA databases [@Caporaso:2011aa]. While this approach is considered useful, many reads could not be mapped to existing rRNA databases [@Thompson:2017aa], leading to loss of information. Reference-free methods, such as Deblur [@Amir2017], and pipelines (DADA2 [@Callahan:2016aa]), have been developed providing sequencing error-corrected single-nucleotide resolution amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Summarizing the 16S data as ASV tables provides finer resolution of the data; consequently, we expect the next phase of the iHMP project to include the data (re)processed at the ASV level.

RSV

- Greengenes are not updated. RDP, SILVA?
Although the Greengenes taxonomy reference database remains a gold-standard in microbiome research [@McDonald:2012aa], it has not been updated since 2013. The use of more recent databases, such as SILVA [@Quast:2013aa], is warranted for maximally accurate reconstruction of mocrobial taxonomy.

- Pipelines differ, need to unify data processing (bioBakery?)
Virtually any large-scale consortium developed their own data processing and analysis pipelines [@Thompson:2017aa].
